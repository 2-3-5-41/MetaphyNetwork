# User Node Example

This is a running example of how to get a basic p2p `user` node up and running with this crate's defaults. Make sure that you use the `user` feature flag to only use `user` specific features while building your own `user` node.

Command(s):
```sh
$ cd examples/user 

$ RUST_LOG=info cargo run
```
