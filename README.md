# MetaphyNetwork

This project will be the backbone of a new metaverse that supports open source and federated communities. The net code will be built with `rust-libp2p` and provide an open API for developers to implement into their own game engines that support low level languages (like rust).

This repo will provide some premade binaries that can let you spin up `RZV`, `DHT`, and `Relay` nodes while providing APIs for creating user nodes that support multiple protocols for easy node discovery and connectivity.
